# Weather-Dashboard
A weather dashboard where you can search for a city and get current weather and a 5 day forecast

Motivation:

I made this weather dashboard to help better understand how to work with APIs and calling and displaying data pulled from the resulting object.

How to use:

When the page loads, you can type any city into the search bar. This will display the current weather for that city (date, weather icon, wind speed, humidity, temperature, and a color-coded UV Index based on severity).

UV color code: 
2 or below: green
2 to 5: yellow
5 to 7: orange
7 to 11: red
11+: light purple

Additionally, a 5 day forecast for that city will be displayed below that (date, weather icon, humidity, temperature).

A button with that city's name will be generated as a list on the right. This button can be clicked to display the weather info for that city.

Credits:

I received significant help from my tutor Simon Rennock, as well as personal friends Rob Mruczek and Dave Mruczek.

I was taught and guided by instructor Ron Bailey, along with the TA's Ankita Patel, Asha Tadimari, Hiram Abraham, Irwin Marcano, Marie Trull, and Radomir Fugiel.
